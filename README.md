# Sudoku Puzzle Generator (with Graph Theory Inspiration)
________________________________________________________________________
This project is a simple web-based Sudoku puzzle generator built using Streamlit. It features 3 difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, and Hard) â€” and visually highlights puzzle numbers for better user experience.

ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This
While exploring graph theory and tools like NetworkX, I came across the concept of graph coloring â€” a powerful technique used to solve constraint problems. Graph coloring forms the foundation for solving real-world challenges like:

- Scheduling and timetabling
- Frequency assignment (e.g., mobile networks)
- Wavelength routing
- Task allocation

To deepen my understanding of how graphs work â€” especially the breadth and depth of entity relationships â€” I wanted to apply this concept in a fun, hands-on way. Sudoku was the perfect candidate.
Even though this app uses backtracking (not NetworkX yet), itâ€™s inspired by graph coloring, and it serves as my stepping stone to visualize and eventually model Sudoku puzzles using graph-based approaches.

ðŸ§  What I Learned
-  Basics of graph coloring as a constraint satisfaction method
-  How Sudoku can be modeled as a graph with 81 nodes and conflict edges
-  Backtracking as a fundamental algorithm
-  Streamlit for rapid web prototyping
-  Visualizing data using colored HTML tables
  
ðŸ”§ Features
- Generate Sudoku puzzles with 3 difficulty levels
- Color-coded cells for better readability
- Simple, responsive UI via Streamlit

ðŸš€ Future Plans
- Solve puzzles using graph coloring via NetworkX
- Let users input their own puzzle and validate it
- Add solving assistant and timer
